# lp-sparql-tsv-queries

In order to help find datasets with (historical) geo-data across The Web and link them the World Historical Gazetteer suggests the [Linked Places format](https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places/blob/master/tsv.md) with a minimum number of required and recommend fields (columns). This repository contains sparql queries that retrieve the required info from sparql endpoints.
The queries are powered via [grlc](http://grlc.io) and thus contain executable API's. To see the grlc-api's goto 'http://grlc.io/api/<name-of-github-repo-owner>/<name-of-github-query-repo/>'. So for this repo, all queries are found at [http://grlc.io/api/rlzijdeman/lp-sparql-tsv-queries/](http://grlc.io/api/rlzijdeman/lp-sparql-tsv-queries/).
