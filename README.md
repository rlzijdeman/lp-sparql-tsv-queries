# lp-sparql-tsv-queries

In order to help find datasets with (historical) geo-data across The Web and link them the World Historical Gazetteer suggests a particular format with a minimum number of required and recommend fields (columns). This repository contains sparql queries that retrieve the required info from sparql endpoints.
The queries are powered via [grlc](http://grlc.io) and thus contain executable API's.
